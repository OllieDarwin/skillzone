Inversity Challenge #3 Solution
=======
Our project aim is to create a maths study app using a student profile which uses machine learning. This allows for the app to tailor questions weighted toward topics the student may be more weak in (as it stores their scores and performance) and furthermore uses a difficulty rating to recommend easier problems if the user is struggling and more difficult problems if they are consistently getting correct answers start providing harder questions. We then use AI to provide in depth explanation if the user is incorrect.
